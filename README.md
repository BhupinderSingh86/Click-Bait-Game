# Mole Click Bait Game

This project was inspired by myself as a click bait to practice more on some basics of Vanilla JavaScript, CSS, HTML & Styled components. Prior to this I had never worked with Styled components library, I never knew what Styled components were or how to use them. Furthermore I learned to use setInterval as a counter, whilst this is possible to do with an external library available I wanted a reason to use and play with setInterval.

# Main Learning Points:

-   React components automatically re-render whenever there is a change in state or props
-   Console.log everything! Time wasted not doing this is invaluable.
-   Using Styled components library rather than CSS file on REACT to relocate the image every time clicked.
-   Working with functions and calling functions within functions.
-   Creating a timer with setInterval, although not best practice to make a timer on REACT this gave me a reason to use and toy around with setInterval.
-   learning to create animation and key frames to make components interactive.
-   Getting use to using the REACT programming Dev tool located on the browser.
-   Learning further how REACT components work / The relationship between the DOM, CSS, JSX & JavaScript

I'm sure there are lots of improvements and learning to do around the above topics but I found working with them so much fun and it was great to learn more new things to add to my arsenal!
